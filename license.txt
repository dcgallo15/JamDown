## JAMDOWN LICENSE

DISCLAIMER: This software is provided for use by the public in the hope that it will be useful, but without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

You may use JamDown for any purpose, and may do as you please with the output. This includes the use of the output commerically.

In addition, you may redistribute JamDown to others; however, all copyright notices in files must be preserved, as must this license. It is not permitted to distribute JamDown under any license other than this. It is also not permitted to charge a fee for the software itself, although you may charge any cost incurred in distributing it, provided you do not profit from doing so.

You may also produce derivative works of JamDown; however, if used publicly they must be available, with source code, under the same license as this. Use of JamDown to build a web site which is publicly available counts as public use for the purpose of this license. Should you publicly make available a derivate work, whether by choice or to comply with this license, you must cause any file that that has been modified to bear a notice clearly indicating that it has been modified by you.

For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that any additional files distributed with JamDown or a derivative need not be made available under this license; they may be licensed as you please.

This license does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of JamDown, except as required for reasonable use in describing JamDown or a derivative thereof.
